# Project Charter

## Project Name
Printer Shop Automation System

## Project Overview
This project aims to streamline and automate the redundant tasks performed by printer shopkeepers, improving efficiency, reducing manual effort, and enhancing customer experience. The solution involves a mobile application for customers to upload documents and manage print configurations and a desktop application for shopkeepers to handle requests, automate print settings, and collect business analytics.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to solve the inefficiencies faced by printer shopkeepers and customers by:
1. Eliminating redundant tasks like manual downloads and print configurations.
2. Enhancing customer satisfaction with real-time updates on print request status.

## Objectives
1. Develop a user-friendly **mobile application** for customers to:
   - Upload documents.
   - Select print configurations (e.g., color, size).
   - Monitor request status dynamically.

2. Build a **desktop application** for shopkeepers to:
   - Accept or decline customer requests.
   - Automate print configurations and jobs.
   - Display real-time print statuses.
   - Generate analytics for business insights.

3. Lay the groundwork for future **UPI payment integration** to simplify transactions.

## Scope
### In Scope
